# Twiter-bot-morpion
This is a bot that allow you to to play the morpion game on Twitter.
This program run with node.js and I use the tweet nmp module to communicate with the Tweeter API.

If you want to play run the code by yourself because I didn't put it on a server.

To play just tweet "@MipikerLeGrand morpion ?" and it will start the game against the bot.
When it's your turn to play just reply or tweet "@MipikerLeGrand your turn *and here the matrix with your move*".
If sombody win or not it will detect it and end the game.

This is what a game looks like :

![Alt text](/gameExample/2.png?raw=true)

You can correct me if there is some English mistakes.

Thanks @CodingTrain
