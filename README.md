# Twiter bot morpion
This is a bot that allow you to to play the morpion game on Twitter.<br/>
This program run with node.js and use the twit NPM module to communicate with the Tweeter API.

If you want to play, run the code by yourself because it isn't on a server.

To play just tweet "@MipikerLeGrand morpion ?" and it will start the game against the bot.<br/>
When it's your turn to play just reply or tweet "@MipikerLeGrand your turn *and here the matrix with your move*".<br/>
If sombody win or not it will detect it and end the game.

This is what a game looks like :
